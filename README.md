As part of my practice, I have developed this project using file handling in C++.It’s a desktop application .It is admin and user mode system. I divided this project into many functions where most of the functions are related to different banking activities. He can update the required data and can read them. you can create a new account, update information of an existing account, view and manage transactions, check the details of an existing account, remove existing account and view customers’ list. Overall, with this project, you can perform banking activities like in a REAL bank. File handling has been used for almost all functions. File has been used to store data related to new account, transaction, editing of account information and viewing of account information.
